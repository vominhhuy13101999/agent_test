# Display Formatting Fixes

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

The Gradio interface was showing raw markdown with escaped `\n` characters instead of proper formatting.

### **Before (❌ Bad)**
```
Document 1: Lease_Document 1.pdf\n- What is the effective 'Date of Lease Contract' for each document?: June 25, 2022\n- Who are the named 'Resident(s)' on each Lease Contract?: Huy Vo, Enkh-Amgalan Batburen\n\n### Document 2: julius leasing documents.pdf\n- What is the effective 'Date of Lease Contract' for each document?: September 3, 2024\n- Who are the named 'Resident(s)' on each Lease Contract?: Huy Vo
```

### **After (✅ Good)**
```markdown
